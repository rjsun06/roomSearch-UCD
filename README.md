## Techniques
- Mongodb Atlas: My laptop sucks so I keep code on replit and data on Atlas. My key is still on replit publicaly. Go check the data if you are interested!
- replit: ditto.

## Goal
The primary goal of the project is to provide an efficient way to search for and utilize available classrooms throughout the campus. By scraping data from the registrar's office and storing it on MongoDB Atlas, RoomSearch offers real-time information on classroom availability.
## Problem Statement

Often, classrooms across the campus remain unoccupied or underutilized, while students struggle to find study rooms in the library. RoomSearch aims to address this issue by providing a comprehensive overview of classroom occupancy. By making this information accessible to students, faculty, and staff, RoomSearch encourages efficient use of available classrooms, reducing the need for additional study spaces and promoting optimal utilization of existing resources.
Features

- Classroom Occupancy: RoomSearch displays the current occupancy status of classrooms across campus in real-time. Users can quickly identify unoccupied classrooms and plan their study or group activities accordingly.

- Class Information: RoomSearch provides detailed information about the ongoing classes in each room, enabling users to know which subjects are being taught. This feature is particularly useful for those who have an interest in auditing classes or are curious about the topics being covered.

- Room Reservation: RoomSearch offers user APIs that allow individuals to reserve available classrooms for specific time slots. This functionality facilitates efficient scheduling and helps prevent conflicts between different users.

## Future Enhancements

- User Interface (UI): Although the current version of RoomSearch doesn't include a user interface, future updates may incorporate a user-friendly interface to enhance the user experience and make it more accessible to a wider audience.

- Advanced Search Filters: Additional search filters, such as room capacity, equipment availability, or specific time slots, can be added to enable users to find the most suitable classrooms for their specific needs.

## Conclusion

RoomSearch serves as a valuable tool in optimizing the utilization of classrooms across campus. By providing real-time occupancy information, class details, and room reservation capabilities, RoomSearch aims to bridge the gap between students, faculty, and available resources. The project encourages efficient use of classrooms and helps meet the growing demand for study spaces, ultimately fostering a conducive learning environment on campus.




(Beore chatGPT: small project, called roomSearch, for a hackthon on campus. I scraped the registrarer office for class infomation and keeps the data on mangodb atlas. romSearchis good because I found classrooms though out campus are not that busy and they are idol time by time. I think the project providing the class room occupation can help people use the classroom more efficiently, and thus can help with the worsing need to  study rooms in the library. moreover, I am also one of those people who get curious when walking by other classrooms. People who like me often think of getting inside and audit the class, but it's hard to decide since we don't know what's going on inside. with roomSearch we no longer need to worry because it tells you which class they are having inside. One may say it's meaningless work because I am just gathering information that is just so boring that the school office doesn't care to exploit. But I don't think so. the idea of roomSearch, when first come to my mind, was everything but a 'schedule builder spider'. It suppose to be a link between all of us: I also wrote some user APIs so people can reserve rooms. (too bad I don't know how to make UI).  )
